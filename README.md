# Amethyst Extra
Extra features for the amethyst engine.

Amethyst has the aim to be workflow-independant. While it is a good idea, it makes prototyping slow because you need to specify many options by yourself.

This library is based on my workflow to accelerate prototyping and, generally speaking, my development speed.

Feel free to use this for yourself or to adapt it to your own workflow by forking it.

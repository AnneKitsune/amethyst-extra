# Amethyst Extra
Extra features for the amethyst engine to help you create games.

Amethyst has the aim to be workflow-independant. While it is a good idea, it makes prototyping slow because you need to specify many options by yourself.

This library is based on the workflow I use to accelerate prototyping and the game developement process.

Feel free to commit new features you think wouldn't fit in amethyst but would fit well as a complementary feature! :)

##Current features

* User Authentification
* AssetLoader with modding support
* Automatic resource saving and loading
* NoClip system to explore your scene
* Relative timer to keep track of time from a specified instant
* Time control system.
* Automatic Ui timer.
* Various types of player controllers.
* (WIP) Terminal based debugging and command handling
